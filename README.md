## FEUPQ Development Report

Welcome to the documentation pages of the _FEUPQ_

You can find here detailed about the product (or mini-app or module), from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by discipline (as of RUP): 

* Business modeling 
  * [Product Vision](./docs/ProductVision.md)
  * [Elevator Pitch]
* [Requirements](./docs/requirements.md)
  * [Use Case Model](./docs/requirements.md#use-case-model)
  * [User stories](./docs/requirements.md#user-stories)
  * [Domain model](./docs/requirements.md#domain-model)
* [Architecture and Design]
  * [Logical architecture]
  * [Physical architecture]
  * [Prototype]
* [Implementation]
* [Test]
* [Configuration and change management]
* [Project management]

So far, contributions are exclusively made by the initial team, but we hope to open them to the community, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.

Please contact us! 

Thank you!
