## Requirements

In this section, you should describe all kinds of requirements for your module: functional and non-functional requirements.

### Use case model

</p>


Briefly describe each use case mentioning the following:

* **Actor**. Name only the actor that will be initiating this use case, i.e. a person or other entity external to the software system being specified who interacts with the system and performs use cases to accomplish tasks. 
* **Description**. Provide a brief description of the reason for and outcome of this use case, or a high-level description of the sequence of actions and the outcome of executing the use case. 
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. Include any activities that must take place, or any conditions that must be true, before the use case can be started (preconditions). Describe also the state of the system at the conclusion of the use case execution (postconditions). 

* **Normal Flow**. Provide a detailed description of the user actions and system responses that will take place during execution of the use case under normal, expected conditions. This dialog sequence will ultimately lead to accomplishing the goal stated in the use case name and description. This is best done as a numbered list of actions performed by the actor, alternating with responses provided by the system. 
* **Alternative Flows and Exceptions**. Document other, legitimate usage scenarios that can take place within this use case, stating any differences in the sequence of steps that take place. In addition, describe any anticipated error conditions that could occur during execution of the use case, and define how the system is to respond to those conditions. 

Example:
|||
| --- | --- |
| *Name* | Purchase tickets online |
| *Actor* |  User | 
| *Description* | The user can see the queues available to choose and after choosing one, the user can comment on the state of the queue, see the queue's state by reading other user's comments, see our program prevision on how the queue will be or see how the queue was in the past. When the user sends a message about the state of a queue, after some time the program will send a survey asking about the current state of the queue. |
| *Preconditions* | - The user is logged in UniFEUP. <br> - The queue has an empty predifined state. <br> - Not marked as a malicious user |
| *Postconditions* | - The user will be able to see his comment in the chat. <br> - The queue state is updated based on the user's message. <br>  |
| *Normal flow* | 1. The customer accesses the web page of the ticketing system.<br> 2. The system shows the list of events with tickets on-sale.<br> 3. The customer selects the event and the number of tickets.<br> 4. If wanted, the costumer may Choose Places.<br> 5. The system shows the total price to pay.<br> 6. The system redirects the customer to Electronic Payment.<br> 7. The system delivers the electronic tickets to the customer with a unique identifier and QR code. |
| *Alternative flows and exceptions* | 1. [Marked as troll]- If in step x or in step y a comment or message is posted by a user which is marked as a troll, then its answers/posts will be rejected.  |

### User stories
This section will contain the requirements of the product described as **user stories**. 

A user story is a description of desired functionality told from the perspective of the user or customer. A starting template for the description of a user story is 

*As a < user role >, I want < goal > so that < reason >.*

User stories should be created and described as [Issues](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/templates/issues) in GitHub with the label "user story". See how to in the video [Creating a Product Backlog of User Stories for Agile Development using GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8ZxTHSKSKE).

You should give a very short name to the issue and, in the "comments" field, add the user story itself (see above), the image(s) of the user interface mockup(s) (see below) and the acceptance test scenarios (see below). 

**INVEST in good user stories**. 
You may add more details after, but the shorter and complete, the better. In order to decide if the user story is good, please follow the [INVEST guidelines](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/).

**User interface mockups**.
After the user story text, you should add a draft of the corresponding user interfaces, a simple mockup or draft, if applicable.

**Acceptance tests**.
For each user story you should write also the acceptance tests (textually in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)), i.e., a description of scenarios (situations) that will help to confirm that the system satisfies the requirements addressed by the user story.

**Value and effort**.
At the end, it is good to add a rough indication of the value of the user story to the customers (e.g. [MoSCoW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) method) and the team should add an estimation of the effort to implement it, for example, using t-shirt sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL).



### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module. 
Also provide a short textual description of each class.
