* We placed the authentication information inside a component, which keeps user data, such as login, register and logout. 
* The system is able to send small form's to the user, in order to keep a constant real-time update on certain queues.
* Inside the FEUP GUI component, we placed all the visual interface which the user can see and interact.
* The request component keeps information about queues state and available capacity.
