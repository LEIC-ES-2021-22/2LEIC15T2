  * Retrospectives: 
     * Did well: </br>
           Work items planning</br>
           Good Communication</br>
           Work consistency</br>
           Fast development in the user GUI app </br>
           
     * Do Differently:</br>
           Bad assigning to user stories (1 person canÂ´t be in 2+ user stories at the same time)</br>
           Assign 2 people to focus on tests implementation </br>
        
         
     * Puzzles: </br>
           Task assigning to iteration backlog </br>
           Choosing the right tags to each work item</br>
           Flutter programming (we are still newbies!) </br>
           Gherkin Tests</br>
