## Test

To make sure that our monkey based team wrote some solid code, we made some tests. Unit and Gherkin.

We used Unit Tests in order to verify and check if the expected output was actually the expected output after an interaction, We used the `flutter_test` dependency.
We also implemented tests using gherkin.

We used the github issues to organize our project. If you want to see our implementation of user stories you can click [here]([open-cx-t2gis%3Aclosed](https://github.com/LEIC-ES-2021-22/2LEIC15T2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22user+story%22)).

All these tests involved a large ammount of work, however, they provide a long-term benefit to the project, making it easier to detect bugs in the future.

Implemented acceptance tests and their respective user story:

Implemented Gherkin Tests:
